Welcome to **MicroNest**! This project showcases the implementation of a micro-frontends architecture using a monorepo setup with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), a progressive Node.js framework.

## Overview

**MicroNest** is designed to demonstrate how multiple micro-frontends can be developed, tested, and deployed independently within a single monorepo. Each micro-frontend serves a specific feature of the application and communicates with a central NestJS backend service.

### Goals

- Microservices architecture.
- Independent development and deployment of frontends.
- Independent backend with NestJS Microservices.
- Efficient collaboration and code management using a monorepo.

```

## Getting Started
- NodeJS >= 22
- npm i


## Running the Project
### Start the application

Run `npx nx serve [appName]` to start the development server. Happy coding!

### Build for production

Run `npx nx build [appName]` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

### Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Running with Docker

### Build the Docker Image
```
nx run [appName]:docker-build
```
### Run the Docker Container
```
docker run [appName]:latest
```

### Docker Compose
```
docker compose up
```


## Adding a New Micro-Frontend
```
nx g @nx/angular:remote appName --host=[hostApp] --port=[portValue]
```

## Adding a New Microservice
```
nx g @nx/nest:app [appName]
```

## Technologies Used
- Nx
- NestJS
- Angular
- Jest
- Cypress
- Swagger
- Docker
